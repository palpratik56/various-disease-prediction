## Project Overview

The **Various Disease Prediction** project aims to implement solutions for different biomedical disease prediction problems (Breast cancer,Kidney stone,diabetes) in a simple yet effective manner. This project utilizes **Streamlit** for deployment, providing an interactive web application where users can input data and receive predictions based on the implemented models.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for disease prediction using Streamlit.
- Implementation of various biomedical disease prediction models.
- Support for multiple disease prediction problems.
- Real-time predictions based on user input.
- Visualizations to display model performance and prediction results.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation and Setup

To set up the Various Disease Prediction project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/palpratik56/various-disease-prediction.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd various-disease-prediction
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download any necessary datasets**: Ensure you have the datasets required for the disease prediction models. Place them in the appropriate directory if specified in the project.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your data and receive predictions.
